# Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota with interests in both **software engineering** and **cybersecurity**. This profile is where I share the projects that push my skills further.  

## ðŸ”¬ Projects  
- **[HistoBowl](https://github.com/TheDoanator/HistoBowl)**  
  A web app for exploring historical bowling statistics. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and SQLite.  
- **[AI Agreement Parser](https://github.com/TheDoanator/AI-Agreement-Parser)**  
  A Python-based tool that uses LLMs and Google Drive API to extract key milestones from legal agreements.  

## ðŸŒ± Focus  
Iâ€™m building in two main directions:  
- **Software Engineering** - web development, data systems, and building polished applications.  
- **Cybersecurity** - secure coding, system analysis, and hands-on labs to sharpen defensive skills.
